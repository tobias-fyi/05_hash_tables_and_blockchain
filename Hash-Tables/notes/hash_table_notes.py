Hash tables :: Day 1 notes - Hash tables

* Hash tables have an underlying Array structure
    * This is why they are as hast at accessing elements as arrays
    * The main difference is that hash tables are indexed using a hash function
    in an unordered fashion, whereas arrays are indexed via contiguous ordered indices
* HashTable code is fairly similar to DynamicArray code
